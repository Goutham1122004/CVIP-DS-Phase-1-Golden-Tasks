Time Series Analysis: Historical Stock Prices
Overview
In this project, I delved into the fascinating realm of time series analysis, specifically focusing on historical stock prices. The objective was to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from temporal data, enabling a better understanding of stock price movements over time.

Dataset
Source: The dataset used for analysis was sourced from portfolio_data.csv.
Content: The dataset consists of historical stock prices with a time component.
Preprocessing: I converted the 'Date' column to datetime format and set it as the index to facilitate time-based analysis.
Analysis
Visualizing Stock Prices Over Time
I started by visualizing the stock prices over time to get an initial overview of the data. The plot showcases the trends and fluctuations in stock prices across different time periods.


Decomposition Analysis
Next, I conducted decomposition analysis using the Seasonal Decompose method from the statsmodels library. This helped me break down the stock prices into trend, seasonal, and residual components, providing deeper insights into the underlying patterns.


Key Findings
Trend Analysis: I identified long-term trends in stock prices, which are crucial for understanding the overall trajectory of the market.
Seasonality: By analyzing seasonal components, I uncovered recurring patterns in stock prices that occur at regular intervals.
Residual Analysis: Examining residual components helped me identify irregularities or anomalies in the data that may require further investigation.
Conclusion
This time series analysis project equipped me with valuable insights into the dynamics of stock price movements over time. By leveraging statistical techniques and visualization tools, I gained a deeper understanding of market trends and patterns, which can inform more informed investment decisions.
